# task_list_1

Custom todo/task list app, my first Flutter project. The main objective for me is to learn Flutter and side goal is to manage my day more effeciently. 

## Current state

A simple list view of tasks. Tasks can be created, modified, deleted. 

## Application description (future plans)

An application to manage your **daily** tasks. In the morning (or on the previous evening) you make a structure for the upcoming day, almost minute-by-minute. You can add task with an estimate on how much time it'll take and then put it on the available spot in your day timeline. So it makes it easy to see how your day looks like task-wise, how much free time do you have and when. 
After that, you start living your day, and the app will notify you when it is the time for your next planned task. But not only that, it also allows you to "start" the task in the application and countdown the real time it takes to finish. This way you'll see what the difference between your planned estimate and the real time so the next time you do similar task you have better understanding on how much time it takes. Later on, you'll be able to see on what you spend time on the most and improve your daily routine accordingly. 

So, the main objective of the app is to help you: 
1) Build and maintain your daily routine
2) Analyze it over long periods of time
3) Improve accordingly and stick to this new improved routine, analyze it again, improve again, and so on.
